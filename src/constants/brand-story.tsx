            FLUX emerged from the vibrant streets of Mumbai in 2023, where tradition meets innovation. 
            We saw a gap in the market - fashion that could bridge the physical and digital worlds seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founders, a collective of designers, developers, and streetwear enthusiasts, came together 
            with a singular vision: to create clothing that tells a story beyond fabric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every piece is crafted with intention, embedding technology that unlocks experiences, 
            not just style. This is fashion reimagined for the digital age.

            We&apos;re not just creating clothes - we&apos;re building a new paradigm where physical garments 
            are gateways to digital experiences. Each FLUX piece is a key to exclusive content, 
            communities, and opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through embedded NFC technology and blockchain verification, your FLUX gear becomes 
            your digital identity, your access pass, and your statement of belonging to a global tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the future of fashion - where what you wear connects you to who you are, 
            both in the physical and digital realms.

            Innovation without responsibility is just noise. Every FLUX piece is made from 
            organic cotton sourced from Tiruppur, India&apos;s textile heartland, ensuring ethical 
            production and fair wages.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;ve eliminated plastic from our packaging and production process. Our micro-batch 
            model means zero overproduction and zero waste. When a design is vaulted, it&apos;s gone forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach isn&apos;t just sustainable - it makes every piece genuinely rare and valuable, 
            creating fashion that respects both people and planet.
